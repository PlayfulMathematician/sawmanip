# Saw Manip

Hi, welcome to my saw manipulator project. This is a project that simulates saws in Appel, the scratch game by griffpatch. It tries random saw manipulations to find the smallest saw speed. The goal is 0 speed. But the minimum is around 4 * 10^-12. It is written in C.  If you find a new min make a pull request.
